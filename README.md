# Dotfiles
This repo contains config files for my linux setup. The files are selectively copied over to the local repo so that git doesn't track all the files in the home dir.

These files are positioned in dirs for Ubuntu but contains configs that also work for MacOS, so when setting up for MacOS, just need to copy the configs into their respective directories. The following configs are in different directories per OS:

**OSX**
- **Sublime Text 3**: $HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/
- **VS Code**: $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/

**Windows**
- **Sublime Text 3**: %APPDATA%/Sublime Text 3/
- **VS Code**: %APPDATA%/Code/
